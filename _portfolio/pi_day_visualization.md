Celebrate π Day with a unique, interactive visualization that displays the digits of π using over 15 different Indian scripts. The digits are arranged in an optimized grid format, featuring a highlighted π symbol in red. Each digit is randomly assigned a script, while the first digit remains recognizable in Latin. Built with Flask for an interactive web experience, the tool also generates high-quality PDFs via LaTeX and XeLaTeX. Customize digit count, randomization, and titles directly from your browser. Inspired from Martin Krzywinski's [Pi day blog](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/pi/piday2019/img/piday.2019.digits.grey.png) in 2019.
