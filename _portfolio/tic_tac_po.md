Ready for some nostalgic fun? Dive into this Python-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game with a user-friendly GUI that even your cat could navigate (no promises on the strategy). Built with tkinter and numpy, this game lets you take on a computer opponent that's about as strategic as a coin flip, giving you a fair shot at victory. Check it out [here](https://github.com/krishnanj/tic-tac-po) and get your game on. Because who doesn't love a good old-fashioned Xs and Os showdown? 

NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!
