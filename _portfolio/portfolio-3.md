title: "Wall decor using pretty maps"
collection: portfolio
---

I recently came across an amazing python package called [Pretty maps](https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps). The images generated are incredibly beautiful but are pretty inconvenient to use for navigation! :)


I was playing around with this package and as usual the first thing I created a map of was my own house. This got me thinking that these pretty maps are pretty good as wall decor. The next idea was to come up with locations and ideas to put up. 

The obvious choice for this was all the addresses I have lived before. Next the idea was how do I put this up on the wall and The good thing about these maps are that they are completely devoid of any text (except for the copyright info of course!).
