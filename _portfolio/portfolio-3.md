title: "Wall decor using pretty maps"
collection: portfolio

I recently came across an amazing python package called [Pretty maps](https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps){:target="_blank"}. The images generated are incredibly beautiful but are pretty inconvenient to use for navigation! :)

I was playing around with this package and as usual the first thing I created a map of was my own house. This got me thinking that these pretty maps are pretty good as wall decor. The next idea was to come up with locations and ideas to put up. 

The obvious choice for this was all the addresses I have lived before. Next the idea was how do I put this up on the wall and The good thing about these maps are that they are completely devoid of any text (except for the copyright info of course!). Now, off I went to generate the image of the maps, get them into the shape and size I wanted. I quickly settled on a hexagon as my shape of choice (because [Hexagons are the Bestagons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY)). I found some cool hexagon [pin boards](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07JNNM31F?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). After they arrived my next challenge was to get the size correct. And boy was this a challenge. After working through some high school math (actually googling for most of the formulae!) I was able to get the shape and size I wanted. Most of this was done using a hacky [python code](https://github.com/armandyam/pretty_maps_decor). I did a quick couple of experimental tries in [DM](https://www.dm.de/foto) photo print shop and finally got the perfect shape for my wall decor. I am quite pleased with the results of this experiment and you can see an example of that below:
