Hi, welcome to my personal website! I am Ajay Mandyam Rangarajan and I currently work as a Software Development Engineering/R&D Software Engineer Manager at Dassault Syst√®mes in Darmstadt, Germany. 

Previously I worked at RWTH Aachen University as a postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Karen Veroy-Grepl. My research focus was on reduced order modeling and parameter reduction. I graduated from RWTH Aachen University, Germany with a Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing) in Computational Sciences in 2021. I was a student of Prof. Georg May and my research focus was on anisotropic meshing for higher order methods with a focus on external aerodynamic applications. 

Outside of work, I am interested in reading (mostly non-fiction) books, training for and participating in marathons/triathlons and traveling. I also am interested in home automation but do not get sufficient time to hack around. 

I will keep this website updated with news about my personal and professional projects/goals and achievements.
