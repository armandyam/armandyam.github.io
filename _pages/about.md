Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! I’m Ajay Mandyam Rangarajan, currently working as R&D Product Manager - CFD Meshing (was previously an R&D Software Engineering Manager) at Dassault Systemes in Darmstadt, Germany.

Before joining Dassault Systemes, I worked at RWTH Aachen University as a postdoctoral researcher with [Prof. Karen Veroy-Grepl](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/karen-veroy-grepl/). My research focused on reduced order modeling and parameter reduction. I earned my Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing) in Computational Sciences from RWTH Aachen University in 2021, where I focused on anisotropic meshing for higher order methods, particularly in external aerodynamic applications, as a student of [Prof. Georg May](https://www.vki.ac.be/index.php/vkidepartments/ar-department-other-menu-100/263-faculty/faculty-in-ar/768-georg-may). My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 4.

Outside of my professional life, I have a passion for reading (mostly non-fiction), training for and participating in marathons and triathlons, and exploring new places. You can find more about my adventures [here](https://armandyam.github.io/others/). Additionally, I enjoy automating various tasks and have a collection of interesting scripts and hacks. You can check out some of these projects in my [portfolio](https://armandyam.github.io/portfolio/).

I plan to keep this website updated with the latest news about my personal and professional projects, goals, and achievements.

Feel free to download my CV to learn more about my academic background, research interests, publications, and professional experiences.
