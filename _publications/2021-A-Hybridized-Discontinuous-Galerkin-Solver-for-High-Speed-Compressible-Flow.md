permalink: /publication/2021-A-Hybridized-Discontinuous-Galerkin-Solver-for-High-Speed-Compressible-Flow
excerpt: 'We present a high-order consistent compressible flow solver, based on a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretization, for applications covering subsonic to hypersonic flow. In the context of high-order discretization, this broad range of applications presents unique difficulty, especially at the high-Mach number end. For instance, if a high-order discretization is to efficiently resolve shock and shear layers, it is imperative to use adaptive methods. Furthermore, high-Enthalpy flow requires non-trivial physical modeling. The aim of the present paper is to present the key enabling technologies. We discuss efficient discretization methods, including anisotropic metric-based adaptation, as well as the implementation of flexible modeling using object-oriented programming and algorithmic differentiation. We present initial verification and validation test cases focusing on external aerodynamics.'
