We have previously proposed a metric-based anisotropic adaption method for tetrahedral grids. In the present paper, we extend our method to goal oriented adaptation. Target-based adaptation is realized using a suitable adjoint-based error estimate for three-dimensional continuous mesh models. The ultimate goal is a parameter free framework, leading to near- optimal anisotropy, and size distribution in the discrete mesh, which is generated from the continuous mesh model. The intended area of application is higher order (discontinuous) Galerkin schemes for convection-diffusion problems. We present the theory for the adaptation method and some numerical results.
