Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines have been shown to have better fuel economy, transient response and cold-start hydrocarbon emissions. Additionally they have lower NOx emissions when operated under lean conditions. However, controlling charge stratification under various load conditions is a major challenge in GDI engines. In the present study a numerical simulations have been performed to understand factors affecting air/fuel mixture preparation under various engine operating conditions. Fuel spray atomization was studied using the two-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. Momentum, energy and species equations were solved for the continuous gas phase. The droplet life history was tracked using the Lagrangian approach. Parameters like fuel injection time, fuel mass flow rate and engine speed was varied to determine their effect on air/fuel mixture preparation inside the cylinder.
