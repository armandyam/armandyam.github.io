        <h1>High Dynamic Time Ranging (HDTR) Images</h1>
        <p>In the past, I had the idea to create High Dynamic Time Ranging (HDTR) images, but like many of my ideas, it remained just that—an idea. The usual culprit? Time. I never got around to implementing it. But now, thanks to GPT and modern tools, I’ve been accelerating my creative process and converting all these dormant ideas into reality with ease.</p>

        <p>The inspiration for this came from two fascinating sources. First, the HDTR project showcased here: <a href="https://mk.bcgsc.ca/fun/hdtr/?gallery" target="_blank">BCGSC HDTR</a>, which creates stunning images that compress time into a single frame. The second was from Eirik Solheim’s year-long time-lapse project (<a href="https://eirikso.com/2011/01/04/one-year-in-one-image/" target="_blank">One Year in One Image</a>), where an entire year’s worth of photos is merged into a single, smooth transition.</p>

            <div class="caption">Top to Bottom</div>

        <p>These images were taken over a 24-hour period around the equinox last year to capture an equal balance of day and night. The final composition features four distinct directions of time movement. Each method provides a different way to visualize how time transitions throughout the day.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I’m thinking of taking this idea a step further—what if I create an HDTR image spanning an entire year? Just like Solheim’s project, I could blend time over a full 12 months to create an even more immersive and intricate representation of change. This would capture not only daily variations but also the gradual shift of seasons, turning a single image into a powerful chronicle of time.</p>

        <p>For those interested, I’ve made the code available on GitHub, so you can try it out yourself and experiment with different blending techniques.</p>
