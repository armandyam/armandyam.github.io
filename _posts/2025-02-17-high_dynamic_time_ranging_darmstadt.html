        <h1>High Dynamic Time Ranging (HDTR) Images</h1>
        <p>In the past, I had the idea to create High Dynamic Time Ranging (HDTR) images, but like many of my ideas, it remained just that—an idea. The usual culprit? Time. I never got around to implementing it. But now, thanks to GPT and modern tools, I’ve been accelerating my creative process and converting all these dormant ideas into reality with ease.</p>

        <p>The inspiration for this came from two fascinating sources. First, the HDTR project showcased here: <a href="https://mk.bcgsc.ca/fun/hdtr/?gallery" target="_blank">BCGSC HDTR</a>, which creates stunning images that compress time into a single frame. The second was from Eirik Solheim’s year-long time-lapse project (<a href="https://eirikso.com/2011/01/04/one-year-in-one-image/" target="_blank">One Year in One Image</a>), where an entire year’s worth of photos is merged into a single, smooth transition.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <img id="raw" class="image" src="/assets/pictures/output_left_to_right_temporal.jpeg" style="clip-path: inset(0 0 0 0);">
        <img id="spatial" class="image" src="/assets/pictures/output_left_to_right_temporal.jpeg">
        <img id="both" class="image" src="/assets/pictures/sports.png">
    </div>

    <div class="controls">
        <span class="arrow" onclick="showImage('raw')">⬆</span>
        <span class="arrow" onclick="showImage('spatial')">⬅</span>
        <span class="arrow" onclick="showImage('both')">➡</span>
        <span class="arrow" onclick="showImage('both')">⬇</span>
    </div>

    <script>
        function showImage(id) {
            document.getElementById('raw').style.clipPath = "inset(0 100% 0 0)";
            document.getElementById('spatial').style.clipPath = "inset(0 100% 0 0)";
            document.getElementById('both').style.clipPath = "inset(0 100% 0 0)";

            document.getElementById(id).style.clipPath = "inset(0 0 0 0)";
        }
    </script>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Comparing Different Blending Approaches</h2>
        <p>To illustrate the blending process, here are three images:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The raw image without any post-processing.</li>
            <li>The image with only spatial blending.</li>
            <li>The image with both spatial and temporal blending.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These images were taken over a 24-hour period around the equinox last year to capture an equal balance of day and night. The final composition features four distinct directions of time movement: left to right, right to left, top to bottom, and bottom to top. The direction of time movement is represented by an arrow on the bottom left of each image.</p>

        <p>Now, I’m thinking of taking this idea a step further—what if I create an HDTR image spanning an entire year? Just like Solheim’s project, I could blend time over a full 12 months to create an even more immersive and intricate representation of change. This would capture not only daily variations but also the gradual shift of seasons, turning a single image into a powerful chronicle of time.</p>

        <p>For those interested, I’ve made the code available on GitHub, so you can try it out yourself and experiment with different blending techniques.</p>

        <p>In hindsight, this project embodies what I’ve been realizing lately: I used to have ideas but no implementation. Now, with the right tools and AI-assisted workflows, I can finally turn all these creative concepts into reality without spending months fumbling through them. And this is just the beginning—who knows what past idea I’ll dig up next?</p>
