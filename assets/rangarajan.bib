abstract = {Automated mesh adaptation is known to be an efficient way to control discretization errors in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. It offers the added advantage that the user only needs to have a minimal expertise in generating appropriate meshes, which is the biggest bottleneck in current CFD workflows. For anisotropic, or highly stretched, simplex (triangles in 2D and tetrahedra in 3D) meshes, the concept of a metric field, that describes a continuous mesh, offers a convenient way to describe the shape and size of mesh elements. Error estimators can be derived and optimized on this continuous mesh to get the optimal metric field, which can be used to generate the corresponding mesh using a metric-conforming mesh generator. The current work aims to review the various error estimators and the corresponding metric fields available for anisotropic mesh adaptation, and compare their mesh convergence behavior for various flow problems. Mathematical formulations are also briefly described here for many of those methods to understand their differences, including the underlying local error estimators used for the global analytic optimization. The metric fields include both solution-based ones that control interpolation error of a scalar field in Lq norm, and also adjoint-based ones that control the error in a particular output functional. All the metric fields considered in this work are implemented in NASA’s open-source grid mechanics package, refine, and FUN3D-SFE, a finite-element solver, is used for the primal and the adjoint solutions. Mesh convergences of output quantities are compared for various benchmark problems, including inviscid and laminar flows around the ONERA M6 wing, supersonic inviscid flow over a low-boom aircraft, and RANS turbulent flow around a high-lift configuration.}

These schemes are especially suited for adaptation, due to their inherent ability to yield robust a posteriori error estimates. On the other hand, metric-based continuous mesh models have previously been proposed for schemes using piecewise polynomial approximation spaces. These models aim to build (near) optimal anisotropic meshes with respect to interpolation error models. The main focus of this article is to formulate continuous-mesh error models for the optimal Petrov-Galerkin methodology using the inbuilt a posteriori error estimate rather than a generic interpolation error model. This pairs the ability to produce near optimal anisotropic simplex meshes with a numerical method that in turn produces optimal stability and approximation properties on these meshes. Error models are formulated either with respect to a suitable norm of the numerical error, or with respect to certain admissible target functionals, in the spirit of goal-oriented adaptation. We demonstrate the fidelity of the proposed metric-based mesh adaptation strategy via numerical examples for convection-diffusion problems on triangular meshes.}

The present work is an extension of a previously proposed mesh-only (h-)adaptation method which uses both a continuous mesh, and a corresponding high-order continuous interpolation operator. In this previous formulation local anisotropy and global mesh density distribution may be determined by analytical optimization techniques, operating on the continuous mesh model. The addition of varying polynomial degree necessitates a departure from purely analytic optimization. However, we show in this article that a global optimization problem may still be formulated and solved by analytic optimization, adding only the necessity to solve numerically a single nonlinear algebraic equation per adaptation step to satisfy a constraint on the total number of degrees of freedom. The result is a tailor suited continuous mesh with respect to a model for the global interpolation error measured in the Lq-norm. From the continuous mesh a discrete triangular mesh may be generated using any metric-based mesh generator.}

Given the total number of degrees of freedom, a metric-based method is proposed, which aims to globally optimize the mesh with respect to the Lq norm of the error. This is done by minimizing a suitable error model associated with the approximation space. Advantages of using a metric-based method in this context are several. First, it facilitates changing and manipulating the mesh in a general anisotropic way. Second, defining a suitable continuous interpolation operator allows the use of an analytic optimization framework that operates on the metric field, rather than the discrete mesh.

With suitable additional packages, we also incorporate the Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin(DPG) solver within the framework of NGSolve. In addition, the adaptation capability has also been shown with FEniCS and the Finite Volume solver SU2. We present results for various scalar problems as well as systems of equations, optimizing meshes with respect to the Lq error in some scalar variable.

ABSTRACT = {We present a high-order consistent compressible flow solver, based on a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretization, for applications covering subsonic to hypersonic flow. In the context of high-order discretization, this broad range of applications presents unique difficulty, especially at the high-Mach number end. For instance, if a high-order discretization is to efficiently resolve shock and shear layers, it is imperative to use adaptive methods. Furthermore, high-Enthalpy flow requires non-trivial physical modeling. The aim of the present paper is to present the key enabling technologies. We discuss efficient discretization methods, including anisotropic metric-based adaptation, as well as the implementation of flexible modeling using object-oriented programming and algorithmic differentiation. We present initial verification and validation test cases focusing on external aerodynamics.},

The novelty of the present work is the extension to more general optimization targets. Here, any solution-dependent functional, which is compatible with an adjoint equation, may be the target of the continuous-mesh optimization. We present the rationale behind the formulation of the optimization problem, with particular emphasis on the continuous mesh model, and the relevant adjoint-based error estimate. Additionally we combine the adjoint-based error estimates with the polynomial optimization strategy from [2] to present a complete hp-adaptation method which shows exponential convergence in the target function.

This mesh optimization framework is designed to handle arbitrary FEM discretization order, geometry order, and element types. In performing a metric-based adaptation, the framework uses a high-order Riemannian metric field to encode the curvature, anisotropy, and global coupling between vertices and high-order geometry nodes. An error model and a cost model are employed to iteratively construct the desired Riemannian metric field and guide a series of globally coupled vertex (r-adaptation) and high-order geometry (q-adaptation) node movements. The resulting mesh is an optimal high-order (curved) mesh that conforms to the specified metric field. The error model requires an error sampling and synthesis procedure, which involves several steps, including element splitting, random sampling of high-order geometry node movements, and estimating the metric-based error kernel on each mesh element. This paper aims to: 1) discuss the theoretical underpinnings of a robust, a posteriori, metric-based error model for qr-adaptation and 2) provide a status update on the 1D HOMES algorithm, which is a native extension of the Mesh Optimization via Error Sampling and Synthesis (MOESS) algorithm to a higher order. }

Besides degrees-of-freedom for velocity and pressure, the viscoelastic stresses introduce an additional unknown to the system. While adaptive meshing techniques are commonly used for simulations of standard fluids, their application is seldom explored in the context of viscoelastic fluids. In this work, we apply an anisotropic mesh adaptation algorithm to solve the viscoelastic flow problem. Our flow solver is based on a logarithmic reformulation of the viscoelastic constitutive laws, which greatly reduces the stringent stability requirements on the mesh size and allows adaptive meshing in this context. For discretization, we use a stabilized finite element method. We present numerical results for a flow past a cylinder. The adaptive method produces near mesh-independent results up to Weissenberg number Wi=0.7. Our results indicate that with an anisotropic refinement strategy, fewer mesh elements are needed to maintain the same error level as with an isotropic refinement strategy. In a stick-slip transition flow, we demonstrate the capability of the adaptive method to produce optimal meshes even in the presence of a singularity in the solution.}
